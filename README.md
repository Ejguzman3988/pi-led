# Pi Based Project

## Description
The goal of this project is to start understanding how to use the raspberry pi.

With zero knowledge I want to create a LED Matrix that I can program using a raspberry pi Zero W. 

## Deliverable
Create LED Matrix that can be programmed via Raspberry Pi Zero W.

Features: 
- Able to create pages based off of the LED Matrix
- Ability to programatically switch between projects (Default Clock - at x time switch to Budgtter)
- Create Projects per Page
- Projects:
    - Led Clock With Blinking Alarm
    - Weather Dashboard
    - Animated Pixel Art
    - Budget Dashboard 
        - Companion app 
            - allows input
            - stores data per day
            - Provides ability to edit data
            - Customizable shell for LED client
